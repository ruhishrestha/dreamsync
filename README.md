# What is ***DreamSync?***
<img src="IMG_7E25AC653C08-1.jpeg" alt="Project Screenshot" width="1000">

Essentially, this device utilizes principles of electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to create targeted low-intensity electrical pulses to basal ganglia pathways. By regulating these pathways, DreamSync seeks to:
- **Balance Circadian Rhythms:** Increases the communication between the basal ganglia and hypothalamic-pineal rhythms to regulate melatonin synthesis. 
- **Expedite Sleep:** Elevate melatonin levels naturally to improve sleep initiation. 
- **Advanced Sleep Quality:** Supports deeper sleep phases by optimizing hormonal balance. 
- **Provide Individualized Treatment:** Adjusts simulation patterns based on EEG feedback and neural activity.

# Key Components of DreamSync

**Software Butterworth Bandpass Filter Algorithm:** Used to allow signals within a specific frequency range (0.5â€“47 Hz) to pass through with minimal signal distortion. 

**Breadboard:** A platform for connecting the prototype and components without soldering. 

**Jumper Cables:** Enable connections between components on the breadboard and to the Arduino for signal flow. 

**AD8232 ECG Sensor with 3-Channel Electrodes:** Amplifies and filters bioelectric signals from the body, making them suitable for processing. 

**Arduino Uno 3:** A microcontroller that processes the signals and sends data to a connected device for analysis. 

**ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter:** Converts the analog signals from the AD8232 into digital form for precise data capture. 

## Future Implementations

**TL074 Amplifier with High (47 Hz) and Low (0.5 Hz) Band Filters:** Provides additional amplification and filtering for cleaner signal output. 

**TES & EEGNet AI Model Integration:** Processes EEG signal data through a convolutional neural network to analyze brainwave patterns.

# How does DreamSync function?

1. **Setup and Powering On:** Wear the DreamSync headband as seen on model and ensure all components (Arduino, ADS1115, AD8232, TL074) are properly connected to the breadboard and powered via a USB connection or battery.
   
3. **Signal Detection:** The electrodes capture faint electrical signals generated by neural activity in your brain. Signal Amplification and Filtering: The AD8232 module amplifies these signals and filters out noise, ensuring they are clear enough for further processing.
   
5. **Signal Conditioning:** The TL074 op-amp provides additional amplification and fine-tunes the signals for optimal quality. Analog-to-Digital Conversion: The processed analog signals are sent to the ADS1115, which converts them into precise digital data.
   
7. **Data Processing:** The Arduino receives the digital signals, applies algorithms (e.g., Butterworth bandpass filtering), and organizes the data for analysis. Data Analysis with AI: The processed EEG data is analyzed by the EEGNet AI model, which identifies patterns in brain activity, such as those associated with sleep states.
   
9. **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors brain signals and adjusts stimulation parameters to align with the user's current sleep-related brain state. Impact on the Brain: The tDCS stimulation encourages activity in neural circuits linked to sleep regulation, promoting deeper, more restful sleep by calming overactive regions and enhancing relaxation.

# The Science Inside Our Brains

**Targeting Basal Ganglia:**
DreamSync targets the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the basal ganglia, which influence the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

**Role of GABA and SCN Regulation:**
The STN and GPi utilize GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that slows brain signals and affects the SCN, a hypothalamic region regulating circadian rhythms by generating time-of-day signals.

**SCN and ANNAT Activation:**
The SCN modulates alkylamine N-acetyltransferase (ANNAT) in the pineal gland, which promotes melatonin synthesis, a key hormone in circadian rhythm regulation.

**Melatonin Synthesis Process:**
ANNAT converts serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, which is further transformed into melatonin by the enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT).
